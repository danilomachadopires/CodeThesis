This paste contain 6 pastes:

DvcomW  : Davidson model with time-weighted likelihood function 
DvsemW :Davidson model without  time-weighted likelihood function
DvvantagemcomW: Davidson model with time-weighted likelihood function, and advantage of white.
DvvantagemsemW:  Davidson model without time-weighted likelihood function, and advantage of white.
DvvantagemcomW1delta:Davidson model with time-weighted likelihood function, and advantage of white for each player.
DVvantagemsemW1delta: Davidsonmodel without time-weighted likelihood function, and advantage of white for each player.

In each past there are 3 files .R

GSMH_BT_DIF..
FGSMH
Diag.R

Where GSMH_BT_DIF. is used for generated 3 chains , FGSMH contain the functions necessary for GSMH_BT_DIF. and  Diag.R is used for diagnostic the converg  the chains.

Is necessary the file granprix2010a2013 in all pastes.
