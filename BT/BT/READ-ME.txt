1--This paste contain 6 pastes:

BTcomW  : Bradley-Terry model with time-weighted likelihood function 
BTsemW : Bradley-Terry model without  time-weighted likelihood function
BTvantagemcomW: Bradley-Terry model with time-weighted likelihood function, and advantage of white.
BTvantagemsemW:  Bradley-Terry model without time-weighted likelihood function, and advantage of white.
BTvantagemcomW1delta:Bradley-Terry model with time-weighted likelihood function, and advantage of white for each player.
BTvantagemsemW1delta: Bradley-Terry model without time-weighted likelihood function, and advantage of white for each player.

In each past there are 3 files .R

GSMH_BT_DIF..
FGSMH
Diag.R

Where GSMH_BT_DIF. is used for generated 3 chains , FGSMH contain the functions necessary for GSMH_BT_DIF. and  Diag.R is used for diagnostic the converg  the chains.

Is necessary the file granprix2010a2013 in all pastes.

2---This file DiagCab are used for calculated AIC (Descriptive analysis of the posterior distributions) and organized data for  graphs

3---The file graficos is created graphs caterpillar of the parameters
